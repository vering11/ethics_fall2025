This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.


About Me
---
My name is Emme Vering. Iâ€™m a student in the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department at St. Olaf College. I'm earning my B.S in Political Science and Computer Science. I have experience working in both state and federal government. I have previously worked on a research and development team, creating technology that can be used in law enforcement applications. With a strong foundation in legal research, government work, technical development, and service to the community, I am interested in working in the intersection between developing technology, policy, and public impact.

Research

I have done research in cellular networks, large language models, exonerative justice, and legal work. I am interested in further examining the ethics of new and developing technologies, specifically how policies are being created around Artifcial Intelligence. I am interested in how computer scientists take their ethical code into account when developing new products, as well as what role computer scientists play in the spread of misinformation. It is incredibly important to think of the role that computer scientists play within society, as people become more and more dependent on technology. 

Personal Life

During my free time, I enjoy reading, running, and doing arts and crafts. My favorite read recently was the Empyrean series by Rebecca Yarros, but I really love to read anything fantasy. I am also really passionate about fashion and traveling. I recently studied abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark and am always eager to share stories from my time abroad.
